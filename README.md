# Predict2Optimize-WiDS-2025
Repo for WiDS 2025 project "Predicting Market Dynamics for Data-Driven Portfolio Optimization"

## Overview  
Portfolio optimization is about allocating investments to maximize return and minimize risk. Classical models assume we know expected returns and covariances. We will use ML to help us learn these directly from data.  
This project teaches how to predict financial quantities using ML and then apply optimization to construct efficient portfolios.  

## Learning Goals  
- Use core Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch  
- Understand supervised learning (regression)  
- Estimate returns and risk from data  
- Apply and visualize mean-variance portfolio optimization  

## Project Structure  

| Week | Focus | Core Learning |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Python for Data Science | NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib |
| 2 | Regression Models | Linear regression, overfitting |
| 3 | Neural Networks | MLPs for predicting returns |
| 4 | Portfolio Optimization | Markowitz model, PyPortfolioOpt |
| 5 | Integration | ML + optimization, efficient frontier |
